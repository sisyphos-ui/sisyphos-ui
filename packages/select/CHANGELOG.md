# Changelog

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 5dadf8c: Nested overlays now close one layer at a time when the user presses Escape. Previously every active `useEscapeKey` subscription received the keystroke and collapsed every layer at once — a Popover opened inside a Dialog would close both, a DatePicker opened inside a Dialog would close both, and so on. The internal hook is now backed by a stack so only the topmost (most recently opened) overlay handles the event, which matches WAI-ARIA expectations and how every native browser dialog behaves.

  This is a transparent improvement for callers — `useEscapeKey`'s signature is unchanged. Re-renders no longer churn the stack thanks to a stable wrapper that always points at the latest callback via a ref.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial public release.

  Sisyphos UI is a headless-flavored, accessible React design system built around CSS variables and SCSS tokens. 30+ components ship as independent, tree-shakable packages, plus a `@sisyphos-ui/ui` umbrella.

  Highlights:
  - **Accessible by default** — WAI-ARIA compliant, keyboard operable, focus-trap / scroll-lock wired into every overlay.
  - **Themeable at runtime** — `applyTheme()`, `setThemeMode()`, and CSS variables under `--sisyphos-*`. Works with any styling stack.
  - **Compound APIs** — `Dialog`, `Tabs`, `Accordion`, `Card`, and `Radio` expose composable subcomponents for structured layouts.
  - **Controlled + uncontrolled** — every interactive component supports both modes through `value` / `defaultValue` / `onChange`.
  - **First-class TypeScript** — strict types, forwardRef + displayName, full prop JSDoc.
